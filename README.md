# Git commands

The basic `git` commands I'm going to be using often are probably `branch`, 
`add`, `commit`, `clone`, `push`, `pull`, `merge`, and `rm`. For school this
semester, `pull` will likely only be used during group projects. I'll also
probably end up muttering `init` a lot because I'm a slob and don't keep my 
work to the same directory.
